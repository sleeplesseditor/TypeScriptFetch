# FetchJSON

An initial experiment in the use of TypeScript, as part of Stephen Grider's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/). 
A simple use of the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), which prints out the first of the entries from the 'Todos' endpoint once the TypeScipt code is compiled (I recommend using [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)).
